# DOSTA-Net: Domain-Shuffle Temporal Attention Network for Vessel Extraction in X-Ray Coronary Angiography Using Synthetic Data

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

Artery extraction from X-ray coronary angiography (XCA) images is essential for accurate diagnosis and treatment of coronary artery diseases. This project introduces **DOSTA-Net**, a deep learning framework that leverages synthetic temporal XCA data for training without requiring manual annotations.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JinkuiH/DOSTA-Net.git
cd DOSTA-Net
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Training

To train the model using synthetic and pseudo-labeled data:

```bash
python training_ours.py
```

Make sure `config.json` is properly set (dataset paths, hyperparameters, etc.).

---

## Inference

Before running inference, please download the pretrained model weights and place them in the weights/ folder. 

To run inference using pretrained weights:

```bash
python inference.py
```

Results will be saved in the directory specified in the file.

## Pretrained Model

You can download our pretrained model from the [Releases]([https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ORcWla7-Ca-b07PasN7dhPU-PVGjxXwF/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ORcWla7-Ca-b07PasN7dhPU-PVGjxXwF/view?usp=sharing)) page.
